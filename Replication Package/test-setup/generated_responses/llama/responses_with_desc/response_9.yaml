    from typing import List, Tuple

    def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        if not numbers:
            return (0, 1)
        else:
            product = 1
            total_sum = 0
            for i in numbers:
                product *= i
                total_sum += i
            return (total_sum, product)
