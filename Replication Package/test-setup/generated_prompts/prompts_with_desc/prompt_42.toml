user='''You are an experienced Python developer. You will be provided with a code block and a corresponding problem description. Your task is to understand the intended functionality, review the code, and generate feedback. Please follow these steps:

1. Analyze the Code: Understand what the code is meant to do.
2. Consider Edge Cases: Reflect on all scenarios in which the code should operate.
3. Evaluate Functionality: Determine whether the code successfully implements the intended functionality across these cases.
4. Classify the Code:
   - If the code requires changes, set classified_type to "Incorrect"
   - If the code does not require any changes, set classified_type to "Correct"
5. Suggest a Corrected Code Block: In the complete_code field, provide the corrected Python code (or the original code if no changes needed).

Important: Use only the classifications "Correct" or "Incorrect" (case sensitive).

Now, please review the code based on the following code block:

@@ -0,0 +1,16 @@
+def car_race_collision(n: int):
+    left_cars = [(i, 0) for i in range(n)]  # Initialize left-moving cars at position 0
+    right_cars = [(i, n) for i in range(n)]  # Initialize right-moving cars at position n
+    collisions = 0  # Initialize collisions to 0
+    for t in range(n):  # Repeat for n time steps
+        # Move left-moving cars one unit to the right
+        left_cars = [(i, p + 1) for i, p in left_cars]
+        # Move right-moving cars one unit to the left
+        right_cars = [(i, p - 1) for i, p in right_cars]
+        # Check for collisions
+        for i, p in left_cars:
+            for j, q in right_cars:
+                if p == q:  # Check if p and q are equal
+                    collisions += 1  # Increment collisions
+    return collisions
+ 

And the following problem description:

"Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars are driving left to right;  simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left.   The two sets of cars start out being very far from
    each other.  All cars move in the same speed.  Two cars are said to collide
    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving
    in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    This function outputs the number of such collisions."

You MUST respond in exactly this YAML format:

```yaml
feedback:
  classified_type: |
    Correct
code:
  complete_code: |
    from typing import List
    
    def function_name(parameters):
        # Your Python code here (corrected or original)
        return result
```

Apply the following rules strictly:
- Answer should be valid YAML and nothing else
- No additional text or explanations outside the YAML structure
- Replace the example code with your actual corrected/original code
- Ensure proper indentation (4 spaces for code inside complete_code)
- Be careful about the indentation and syntax of your suggested code block, make sure it can run without problems'''
