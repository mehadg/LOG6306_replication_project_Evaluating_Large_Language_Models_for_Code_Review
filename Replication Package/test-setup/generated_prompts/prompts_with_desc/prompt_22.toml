user='''You are an experienced Python developer. You will be provided with a code block and a corresponding problem description. Your task is to understand the intended functionality, review the code, and generate feedback. Please follow these steps:

1. Analyze the Code: Understand what the code is meant to do.
2. Consider Edge Cases: Reflect on all scenarios in which the code should operate.
3. Evaluate Functionality: Determine whether the code successfully implements the intended functionality across these cases.
4. Classify the Code:
   - If the code requires changes, set classified_type to "Incorrect"
   - If the code does not require any changes, set classified_type to "Correct"
5. Suggest a Corrected Code Block: In the complete_code field, provide the corrected Python code (or the original code if no changes needed).

Important: Use only the classifications "Correct" or "Incorrect" (case sensitive).

Now, please review the code based on the following code block:

@@ -0,0 +1,12 @@
+from typing import List
+
+def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:
+    
+    # Find the minimum and maximum numbers in the list
+    min_num = min(numbers)
+    max_num = max(numbers)
+    # Calculate the range of the numbers
+    range_num = max_num - min_num
+    # Return the rescaled numbers
+    return [(num - min_num) / range_num for num in numbers]
+ 

And the following problem description:

"Given list of numbers (of at least two elements), apply a linear transform to that list,
    such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1
    >>> rescale_to_unit([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0])
    [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]"

You MUST respond in exactly this YAML format:

```yaml
feedback:
  classified_type: |
    Correct
code:
  complete_code: |
    from typing import List
    
    def function_name(parameters):
        # Your Python code here (corrected or original)
        return result
```

Apply the following rules strictly:
- Answer should be valid YAML and nothing else
- No additional text or explanations outside the YAML structure
- Replace the example code with your actual corrected/original code
- Ensure proper indentation (4 spaces for code inside complete_code)
- Be careful about the indentation and syntax of your suggested code block, make sure it can run without problems'''
