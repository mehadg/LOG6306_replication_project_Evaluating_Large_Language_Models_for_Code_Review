user='''You are an experienced Python developer. You will be provided with a code block and a corresponding problem description. Your task is to understand the intended functionality, review the code, and generate feedback. Please follow these steps:

1. Analyze the Code: Understand what the code is meant to do.
2. Consider Edge Cases: Reflect on all scenarios in which the code should operate.
3. Evaluate Functionality: Determine whether the code successfully implements the intended functionality across these cases.
4. Classify the Code:
   - If the code requires changes, set classified_type to "Incorrect"
   - If the code does not require any changes, set classified_type to "Correct"
5. Suggest a Corrected Code Block: In the complete_code field, provide the corrected Python code (or the original code if no changes needed).

Important: Use only the classifications "Correct" or "Incorrect" (case sensitive).

Now, please review the code based on the following code block:

+def move_one_ball(arr):
+    if len(arr)==0:
+      return True
+    sorted_array=sorted(arr)
+    my_arr=[]
+    
+    min_value=min(arr)
+    min_index=arr.index(min_value)
+    my_arr=arr[min_index:]+arr[0:min_index]
+    for i in range(len(arr)):
+      if my_arr[i]!=sorted_array[i]:
+        return False
+    return True
+ 

And the following problem description:

"We have an array 'arr' of N integers arr[1], arr[2], ..., arr[N].The
    numbers in the array will be randomly ordered. Your task is to determine if
    it is possible to get an array sorted in non-decreasing order by performing 
    the following operation on the given array:
        You are allowed to perform right shift operation any number of times.
    
    One right shift operation means shifting all elements of the array by one
    position in the right direction. The last element of the array will be moved to
    the starting position in the array i.e. 0th index. 

    If it is possible to obtain the sorted array by performing the above operation
    then return True else return False.
    If the given array is empty then return True.

    Note: The given list is guaranteed to have unique elements.

    For Example:
    
    move_one_ball([3, 4, 5, 1, 2])==>True
    Explanation: By performin 2 right shift operations, non-decreasing order can
                 be achieved for the given array.
    move_one_ball([3, 5, 4, 1, 2])==>False
    Explanation:It is not possible to get non-decreasing order for the given
                array by performing any number of right shift operations."

You MUST respond in exactly this YAML format:

```yaml
feedback:
  classified_type: |
    Correct
code:
  complete_code: |
    from typing import List
    
    def function_name(parameters):
        # Your Python code here (corrected or original)
        return result
```

Apply the following rules strictly:
- Answer should be valid YAML and nothing else
- No additional text or explanations outside the YAML structure
- Replace the example code with your actual corrected/original code
- Ensure proper indentation (4 spaces for code inside complete_code)
- Be careful about the indentation and syntax of your suggested code block, make sure it can run without problems'''
