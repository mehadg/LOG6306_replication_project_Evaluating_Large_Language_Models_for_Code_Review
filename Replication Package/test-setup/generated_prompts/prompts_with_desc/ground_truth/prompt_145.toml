user='''You are an experienced Python developer. You will be provided with a code block and a corresponding problem description. Your task is to understand the intended functionality, review the code, and generate feedback. Please follow these steps:

1. Analyze the Code: Understand what the code is meant to do.
2. Consider Edge Cases: Reflect on all scenarios in which the code should operate.
3. Evaluate Functionality: Determine whether the code successfully implements the intended functionality across these cases.
4. Classify the Code:
   - If the code requires changes, set classified_type to "Incorrect"
   - If the code does not require any changes, set classified_type to "Correct"
5. Suggest a Corrected Code Block: In the complete_code field, provide the corrected Python code (or the original code if no changes needed).

Important: Use only the classifications "Correct" or "Incorrect" (case sensitive).

Now, please review the code based on the following code block:

@@ -0,0 +1,9 @@
+def simplify(x, n):
+    a, b = x.split("/")
+    c, d = n.split("/")
+    numerator = int(a) * int(c)
+    denom = int(b) * int(d)
+    if (numerator/denom == int(numerator/denom)):
+        return True
+    return False
+ 

And the following problem description:

"Your task is to implement a function that will simplify the expression
    x * n. The function returns True if x * n evaluates to a whole number and False
    otherwise. Both x and n, are string representation of a fraction, and have the following format,
    <numerator>/<denominator> where both numerator and denominator are positive whole numbers.

    You can assume that x, and n are valid fractions, and do not have zero as denominator.

    simplify("1/5", "5/1") = True
    simplify("1/6", "2/1") = False
    simplify("7/10", "10/2") = False"

You MUST respond in exactly this YAML format:

```yaml
feedback:
  classified_type: |
    Correct
code:
  complete_code: |
    from typing import List
    
    def function_name(parameters):
        # Your Python code here (corrected or original)
        return result
```

Apply the following rules strictly:
- Answer should be valid YAML and nothing else
- No additional text or explanations outside the YAML structure
- Replace the example code with your actual corrected/original code
- Ensure proper indentation (4 spaces for code inside complete_code)
- Be careful about the indentation and syntax of your suggested code block, make sure it can run without problems'''
