user='''You are an experienced Python developer. You will be provided with a code block and a corresponding problem description. Your task is to understand the intended functionality, review the code, and generate feedback. Please follow these steps:

1. Analyze the Code: Understand what the code is meant to do.
2. Consider Edge Cases: Reflect on all scenarios in which the code should operate.
3. Evaluate Functionality: Determine whether the code successfully implements the intended functionality across these cases.
4. Classify the Code:
   - If the code requires changes, set classified_type to "Incorrect"
   - If the code does not require any changes, set classified_type to "Correct"
5. Suggest a Corrected Code Block: In the complete_code field, provide the corrected Python code (or the original code if no changes needed).

Important: Use only the classifications "Correct" or "Incorrect" (case sensitive).

Now, please review the code based on the following code block:

+def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:
+    closest_pair = None
+    distance = None
+
+    for idx, elem in enumerate(numbers):
+        for idx2, elem2 in enumerate(numbers):
+            if idx != idx2:
+                if distance is None:
+                    distance = abs(elem - elem2)
+                    closest_pair = tuple(sorted([elem, elem2]))
+                else:
+                    new_distance = abs(elem - elem2)
+                    if new_distance < distance:
+                        distance = new_distance
+                        closest_pair = tuple(sorted([elem, elem2]))
+
+    return closest_pair
+ 

And the following problem description:

"From a supplied list of numbers (of length at least two) select and return two that are the closest to each
    other and return them in order (smaller number, larger number).
    >>> find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2])
    (2.0, 2.2)
    >>> find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0])
    (2.0, 2.0)"

You MUST respond in exactly this YAML format:

```yaml
feedback:
  classified_type: |
    Correct
code:
  complete_code: |
    from typing import List
    
    def function_name(parameters):
        # Your Python code here (corrected or original)
        return result
```

Apply the following rules strictly:
- Answer should be valid YAML and nothing else
- No additional text or explanations outside the YAML structure
- Replace the example code with your actual corrected/original code
- Ensure proper indentation (4 spaces for code inside complete_code)
- Be careful about the indentation and syntax of your suggested code block, make sure it can run without problems'''
