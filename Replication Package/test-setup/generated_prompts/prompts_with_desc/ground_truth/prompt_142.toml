user='''You are an experienced Python developer. You will be provided with a code block and a corresponding problem description. Your task is to understand the intended functionality, review the code, and generate feedback. Please follow these steps:

1. Analyze the Code: Understand what the code is meant to do.
2. Consider Edge Cases: Reflect on all scenarios in which the code should operate.
3. Evaluate Functionality: Determine whether the code successfully implements the intended functionality across these cases.
4. Classify the Code:
   - If the code requires changes, set classified_type to "Incorrect"
   - If the code does not require any changes, set classified_type to "Correct"
5. Suggest a Corrected Code Block: In the complete_code field, provide the corrected Python code (or the original code if no changes needed).

Important: Use only the classifications "Correct" or "Incorrect" (case sensitive).

Now, please review the code based on the following code block:

@@ -0,0 +1,16 @@
+def file_name_check(file_name):
+    suf = ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']
+    lst = file_name.split(sep='.')
+    if len(lst) != 2:
+        return 'No'
+    if not lst[1] in suf:
+        return 'No'
+    if len(lst[0]) == 0:
+        return 'No'
+    if not lst[0][0].isalpha():
+        return 'No'
+    t = len([x for x in lst[0] if x.isdigit()])
+    if t > 3:
+        return 'No'
+    return 'Yes'
+ 

And the following problem description:

"Create a function which takes a string representing a file's name, and returns
    'Yes' if the the file's name is valid, and returns 'No' otherwise.
    A file's name is considered to be valid if and only if all the following conditions 
    are met:
    - There should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.
    - The file's name contains exactly one dot '.'
    - The substring before the dot should not be empty, and it starts with a letter from 
    the latin alphapet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').
    - The substring after the dot should be one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']
    Examples:
    file_name_check("example.txt") # => 'Yes'
    file_name_check("1example.dll") # => 'No' (the name should start with a latin alphapet letter)"

You MUST respond in exactly this YAML format:

```yaml
feedback:
  classified_type: |
    Correct
code:
  complete_code: |
    from typing import List
    
    def function_name(parameters):
        # Your Python code here (corrected or original)
        return result
```

Apply the following rules strictly:
- Answer should be valid YAML and nothing else
- No additional text or explanations outside the YAML structure
- Replace the example code with your actual corrected/original code
- Ensure proper indentation (4 spaces for code inside complete_code)
- Be careful about the indentation and syntax of your suggested code block, make sure it can run without problems'''
