user='''You are an experienced Python developer. You will be provided with a code block and a corresponding problem description. Your task is to understand the intended functionality, review the code, and generate feedback. Please follow these steps:

1. Analyze the Code: Understand what the code is meant to do.
2. Consider Edge Cases: Reflect on all scenarios in which the code should operate.
3. Evaluate Functionality: Determine whether the code successfully implements the intended functionality across these cases.
4. Classify the Code:
   - If the code requires changes, set classified_type to "Incorrect"
   - If the code does not require any changes, set classified_type to "Correct"
5. Suggest a Corrected Code Block: In the complete_code field, provide the corrected Python code (or the original code if no changes needed).

Important: Use only the classifications "Correct" or "Incorrect" (case sensitive).

Now, please review the code based on the following code block:

@@ -0,0 +1,13 @@
+def f(n):
+    ret = []
+    for i in range(1,n+1):
+        if i%2 == 0:
+            x = 1
+            for j in range(1,i+1): x *= j
+            ret += [x]
+        else:
+            x = 0
+            for j in range(1,i+1): x += j
+            ret += [x]
+    return ret
+ 

And the following problem description:

"Implement the function f that takes n as a parameter,
    and returns a list of size n, such that the value of the element at index i is the factorial of i if i is even
    or the sum of numbers from 1 to i otherwise.
    i starts from 1.
    the factorial of i is the multiplication of the numbers from 1 to i (1 * 2 * ... * i).
    Example:
    f(5) == [1, 2, 6, 24, 15]"

You MUST respond in exactly this YAML format:

```yaml
feedback:
  classified_type: |
    Correct
code:
  complete_code: |
    from typing import List
    
    def function_name(parameters):
        # Your Python code here (corrected or original)
        return result
```

Apply the following rules strictly:
- Answer should be valid YAML and nothing else
- No additional text or explanations outside the YAML structure
- Replace the example code with your actual corrected/original code
- Ensure proper indentation (4 spaces for code inside complete_code)
- Be careful about the indentation and syntax of your suggested code block, make sure it can run without problems'''
