user='''You are an experienced Python developer. You will be provided with a code block and a corresponding problem description. Your task is to understand the intended functionality, review the code, and generate feedback. Please follow these steps:

1. Analyze the Code: Understand what the code is meant to do.
2. Consider Edge Cases: Reflect on all scenarios in which the code should operate.
3. Evaluate Functionality: Determine whether the code successfully implements the intended functionality across these cases.
4. Classify the Code:
   - If the code requires changes, set classified_type to "Incorrect"
   - If the code does not require any changes, set classified_type to "Correct"
5. Suggest a Corrected Code Block: In the complete_code field, provide the corrected Python code (or the original code if no changes needed).

Important: Use only the classifications "Correct" or "Incorrect" (case sensitive).

Now, please review the code based on the following code block:

@@ -0,0 +1,4 @@
+def parse_music(music_string: str) -> List[int]:
+    note_map = {'o': 4, 'o|': 2, '.|': 1}
+    return [note_map[x] for x in music_string.split(' ') if x]
+ 

And the following problem description:

"Input to this function is a string representing musical notes in a special ASCII format.
    Your task is to parse this string and return list of integers corresponding to how many beats does each
    not last.

    Here is a legend:
    'o' - whole note, lasts four beats
    'o|' - half note, lasts two beats
    '.|' - quater note, lasts one beat

    >>> parse_music('o o| .| o| o| .| .| .| .| o o')
    [4, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 4, 4]"

You MUST respond in exactly this YAML format:

```yaml
feedback:
  classified_type: |
    Correct
code:
  complete_code: |
    from typing import List
    
    def function_name(parameters):
        # Your Python code here (corrected or original)
        return result
```

Apply the following rules strictly:
- Answer should be valid YAML and nothing else
- No additional text or explanations outside the YAML structure
- Replace the example code with your actual corrected/original code
- Ensure proper indentation (4 spaces for code inside complete_code)
- Be careful about the indentation and syntax of your suggested code block, make sure it can run without problems'''
