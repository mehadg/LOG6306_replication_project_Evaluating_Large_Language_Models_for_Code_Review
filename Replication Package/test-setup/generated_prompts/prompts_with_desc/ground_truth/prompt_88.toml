user='''You are an experienced Python developer. You will be provided with a code block and a corresponding problem description. Your task is to understand the intended functionality, review the code, and generate feedback. Please follow these steps:

1. Analyze the Code: Understand what the code is meant to do.
2. Consider Edge Cases: Reflect on all scenarios in which the code should operate.
3. Evaluate Functionality: Determine whether the code successfully implements the intended functionality across these cases.
4. Classify the Code:
   - If the code requires changes, set classified_type to "Incorrect"
   - If the code does not require any changes, set classified_type to "Correct"
5. Suggest a Corrected Code Block: In the complete_code field, provide the corrected Python code (or the original code if no changes needed).

Important: Use only the classifications "Correct" or "Incorrect" (case sensitive).

Now, please review the code based on the following code block:

@@ -0,0 +1,4 @@
+def get_row(lst, x):
+    coords = [(i, j) for i in range(len(lst)) for j in range(len(lst[i])) if lst[i][j] == x]
+    return sorted(sorted(coords, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True), key=lambda x: x[0])
+ 

And the following problem description:

"You are given a 2 dimensional data, as a nested lists,
    which is similar to matrix, however, unlike matrices,
    each row may contain a different number of columns.
    Given lst, and integer x, find integers x in the list,
    and return list of tuples, [(x1, y1), (x2, y2) ...] such that
    each tuple is a coordinate - (row, columns), starting with 0.
    Sort coordinates initially by rows in ascending order.
    Also, sort coordinates of the row by columns in descending order.
    
    Examples:
    get_row([
      [1,2,3,4,5,6],
      [1,2,3,4,1,6],
      [1,2,3,4,5,1]
    ], 1) == [(0, 0), (1, 4), (1, 0), (2, 5), (2, 0)]
    get_row([], 1) == []
    get_row([[], [1], [1, 2, 3]], 3) == [(2, 2)]"

You MUST respond in exactly this YAML format:

```yaml
feedback:
  classified_type: |
    Correct
code:
  complete_code: |
    from typing import List
    
    def function_name(parameters):
        # Your Python code here (corrected or original)
        return result
```

Apply the following rules strictly:
- Answer should be valid YAML and nothing else
- No additional text or explanations outside the YAML structure
- Replace the example code with your actual corrected/original code
- Ensure proper indentation (4 spaces for code inside complete_code)
- Be careful about the indentation and syntax of your suggested code block, make sure it can run without problems'''
