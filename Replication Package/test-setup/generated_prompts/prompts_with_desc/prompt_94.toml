user='''You are an experienced Python developer. You will be provided with a code block and a corresponding problem description. Your task is to understand the intended functionality, review the code, and generate feedback. Please follow these steps:

1. Analyze the Code: Understand what the code is meant to do.
2. Consider Edge Cases: Reflect on all scenarios in which the code should operate.
3. Evaluate Functionality: Determine whether the code successfully implements the intended functionality across these cases.
4. Classify the Code:
   - If the code requires changes, set classified_type to "Incorrect"
   - If the code does not require any changes, set classified_type to "Correct"
5. Suggest a Corrected Code Block: In the complete_code field, provide the corrected Python code (or the original code if no changes needed).

Important: Use only the classifications "Correct" or "Incorrect" (case sensitive).

Now, please review the code based on the following code block:

@@ -0,0 +1,13 @@
+def encode(message):
+    def transform(c):
+        if c.isalpha():
+            if c.islower():
+                c = c.upper()
+            else:
+                c = c.lower()
+            if c in 'AEIOU':
+                return chr((ord(c) - 65 + 2) % 26 + 65)
+        return c
+
+    return ''.join(transform(c) for c in message)
+ 

And the following problem description:

"Write a function that takes a message, and encodes in such a 
    way that it swaps case of all letters, replaces all vowels in 
    the message with the letter that appears 2 places ahead of that 
    vowel in the english alphabet. 
    Assume only letters. 
    
    Examples:
    >>> encode('test')
    'TGST'
    >>> encode('This is a message')
    'tHKS KS C MGSSCGG'"

You MUST respond in exactly this YAML format:

```yaml
feedback:
  classified_type: |
    Correct
code:
  complete_code: |
    from typing import List
    
    def function_name(parameters):
        # Your Python code here (corrected or original)
        return result
```

Apply the following rules strictly:
- Answer should be valid YAML and nothing else
- No additional text or explanations outside the YAML structure
- Replace the example code with your actual corrected/original code
- Ensure proper indentation (4 spaces for code inside complete_code)
- Be careful about the indentation and syntax of your suggested code block, make sure it can run without problems'''
