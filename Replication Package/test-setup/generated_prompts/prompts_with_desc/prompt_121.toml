user='''You are an experienced Python developer. You will be provided with a code block and a corresponding problem description. Your task is to understand the intended functionality, review the code, and generate feedback. Please follow these steps:

1. Analyze the Code: Understand what the code is meant to do.
2. Consider Edge Cases: Reflect on all scenarios in which the code should operate.
3. Evaluate Functionality: Determine whether the code successfully implements the intended functionality across these cases.
4. Classify the Code:
   - If the code requires changes, set classified_type to "Incorrect"
   - If the code does not require any changes, set classified_type to "Correct"
5. Suggest a Corrected Code Block: In the complete_code field, provide the corrected Python code (or the original code if no changes needed).

Important: Use only the classifications "Correct" or "Incorrect" (case sensitive).

Now, please review the code based on the following code block:

@@ -0,0 +1,4 @@
+def maximum(arr, k):
+    arr.sort(reverse=True)
+    return arr[:k]
+ 

And the following problem description:

"Given an array arr of integers and a positive integer k, return a sorted list 
    of length k with the maximum k numbers in arr.

    Example 1:

        Input: arr = [-3, -4, 5], k = 3
        Output: [-4, -3, 5]

    Example 2:

        Input: arr = [4, -4, 4], k = 2
        Output: [4, 4]

    Example 3:

        Input: arr = [-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1], k = 1
        Output: [2]

    Note:
        1. The length of the array will be in the range of [1, 1000].
        2. The elements in the array will be in the range of [-1000, 1000].
        3. 0 <= k <= len(arr)"

You MUST respond in exactly this YAML format:

```yaml
feedback:
  classified_type: |
    Correct
code:
  complete_code: |
    from typing import List
    
    def function_name(parameters):
        # Your Python code here (corrected or original)
        return result
```

Apply the following rules strictly:
- Answer should be valid YAML and nothing else
- No additional text or explanations outside the YAML structure
- Replace the example code with your actual corrected/original code
- Ensure proper indentation (4 spaces for code inside complete_code)
- Be careful about the indentation and syntax of your suggested code block, make sure it can run without problems'''
