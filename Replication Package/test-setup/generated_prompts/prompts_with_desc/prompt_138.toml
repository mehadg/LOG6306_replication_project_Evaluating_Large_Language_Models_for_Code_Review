user='''You are an experienced Python developer. You will be provided with a code block and a corresponding problem description. Your task is to understand the intended functionality, review the code, and generate feedback. Please follow these steps:

1. Analyze the Code: Understand what the code is meant to do.
2. Consider Edge Cases: Reflect on all scenarios in which the code should operate.
3. Evaluate Functionality: Determine whether the code successfully implements the intended functionality across these cases.
4. Classify the Code:
   - If the code requires changes, set classified_type to "Incorrect"
   - If the code does not require any changes, set classified_type to "Correct"
5. Suggest a Corrected Code Block: In the complete_code field, provide the corrected Python code (or the original code if no changes needed).

Important: Use only the classifications "Correct" or "Incorrect" (case sensitive).

Now, please review the code based on the following code block:

@@ -0,0 +1,21 @@
+def compare_one(a, b):
+    try:
+        a = float(a.replace(",", "."))
+    except AttributeError:
+        pass
+    try:
+        b = float(b.replace(",", "."))
+    except AttributeError:
+        pass
+    
+    if isinstance(a, (int, float)) and isinstance(b, (int, float)):
+        if a == b:
+            return None
+        elif a > b:
+            return a
+        else:
+            return b
+    else:
+        return a if a == b else max(a, b)
+
+ 

And the following problem description:

"Create a function that takes integers, floats, or strings representing
    real numbers, and returns the larger variable in its given variable type.
    Return None if the values are equal.
    Note: If a real number is represented as a string, the floating point might be . or ,

    compare_one(1, 2.5) ➞ 2.5
    compare_one(1, "2,3") ➞ "2,3"
    compare_one("5,1", "6") ➞ "6"
    compare_one("1", 1) ➞ None"

You MUST respond in exactly this YAML format:

```yaml
feedback:
  classified_type: |
    Correct
code:
  complete_code: |
    from typing import List
    
    def function_name(parameters):
        # Your Python code here (corrected or original)
        return result
```

Apply the following rules strictly:
- Answer should be valid YAML and nothing else
- No additional text or explanations outside the YAML structure
- Replace the example code with your actual corrected/original code
- Ensure proper indentation (4 spaces for code inside complete_code)
- Be careful about the indentation and syntax of your suggested code block, make sure it can run without problems'''
