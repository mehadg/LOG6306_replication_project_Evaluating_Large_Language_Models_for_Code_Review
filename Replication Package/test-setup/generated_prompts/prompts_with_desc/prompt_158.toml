user='''You are an experienced Python developer. You will be provided with a code block and a corresponding problem description. Your task is to understand the intended functionality, review the code, and generate feedback. Please follow these steps:

1. Analyze the Code: Understand what the code is meant to do.
2. Consider Edge Cases: Reflect on all scenarios in which the code should operate.
3. Evaluate Functionality: Determine whether the code successfully implements the intended functionality across these cases.
4. Classify the Code:
   - If the code requires changes, set classified_type to "Incorrect"
   - If the code does not require any changes, set classified_type to "Correct"
5. Suggest a Corrected Code Block: In the complete_code field, provide the corrected Python code (or the original code if no changes needed).

Important: Use only the classifications "Correct" or "Incorrect" (case sensitive).

Now, please review the code based on the following code block:

@@ -0,0 +1,21 @@
+def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):
+    
+    # first find the hypotenuse of the triangle
+    hypotenuse = max(a, b, c)
+    # then find the other two sides of the triangle
+    if hypotenuse == a:
+        side1 = b
+        side2 = c
+    elif hypotenuse == b:
+        side1 = a
+        side2 = c
+    else:
+        side1 = a
+        side2 = b
+
+    # check if the Pythagorean theorem holds true
+    if hypotenuse ** 2 == (side1 ** 2) + (side2 ** 2):
+        return True
+    else:
+        return False
+ 

And the following problem description:

"Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return True if the three
    sides form a right-angled triangle, False otherwise.
    A right-angled triangle is a triangle in which one angle is right angle or 
    90 degree.
    Example:
    right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5) == True
    right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False"

You MUST respond in exactly this YAML format:

```yaml
feedback:
  classified_type: |
    Correct
code:
  complete_code: |
    from typing import List
    
    def function_name(parameters):
        # Your Python code here (corrected or original)
        return result
```

Apply the following rules strictly:
- Answer should be valid YAML and nothing else
- No additional text or explanations outside the YAML structure
- Replace the example code with your actual corrected/original code
- Ensure proper indentation (4 spaces for code inside complete_code)
- Be careful about the indentation and syntax of your suggested code block, make sure it can run without problems'''
