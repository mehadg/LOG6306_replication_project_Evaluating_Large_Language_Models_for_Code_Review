user='''You are an experienced Python developer. You will be provided with a code block and a corresponding problem description. Your task is to understand the intended functionality, review the code, and generate feedback. Please follow these steps:

1. Analyze the Code: Understand what the code is meant to do.
2. Consider Edge Cases: Reflect on all scenarios in which the code should operate.
3. Evaluate Functionality: Determine whether the code successfully implements the intended functionality across these cases.
4. Classify the Code:
   - If the code requires changes, set classified_type to "Incorrect"
   - If the code does not require any changes, set classified_type to "Correct"
5. Suggest a Corrected Code Block: In the complete_code field, provide the corrected Python code (or the original code if no changes needed).

Important: Use only the classifications "Correct" or "Incorrect" (case sensitive).

Now, please review the code based on the following code block:

+        return []
+    min_val = float('inf')
+    min_index = float('inf')
+    for i, x in enumerate(arr):

+ 

And the following problem description:

""Given an array representing a branch of a tree that has non-negative integer nodes
    your task is to pluck one of the nodes and return it.
    The plucked node should be the node with the smallest even value.
    If multiple nodes with the same smallest even value are found return the node that has smallest index.

    The plucked node should be returned in a list, [ smalest_value, its index ],
    If there are no even values or the given array is empty, return [].

    Example 1:
        Input: [4,2,3]
        Output: [2, 1]
        Explanation: 2 has the smallest even value, and 2 has the smallest index.

    Example 2:
        Input: [1,2,3]
        Output: [2, 1]
        Explanation: 2 has the smallest even value, and 2 has the smallest index. 

    Example 3:
        Input: []
        Output: []
    
    Example 4:
        Input: [5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2]
        Output: [0, 1]
        Explanation: 0 is the smallest value, but  there are two zeros,
                     so we will choose the first zero, which has the smallest index.

    Constraints:
        * 1 <= nodes.length <= 10000
        * 0 <= node.value"

You MUST respond in exactly this YAML format:

```yaml
feedback:
  classified_type: |
    Correct
code:
  complete_code: |
    from typing import List
    
    def function_name(parameters):
        # Your Python code here (corrected or original)
        return result
```

Apply the following rules strictly:
- Answer should be valid YAML and nothing else
- No additional text or explanations outside the YAML structure
- Replace the example code with your actual corrected/original code
- Ensure proper indentation (4 spaces for code inside complete_code)
- Be careful about the indentation and syntax of your suggested code block, make sure it can run without problems'''
