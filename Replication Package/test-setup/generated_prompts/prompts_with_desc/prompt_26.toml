user='''You are an experienced Python developer. You will be provided with a code block and a corresponding problem description. Your task is to understand the intended functionality, review the code, and generate feedback. Please follow these steps:

1. Analyze the Code: Understand what the code is meant to do.
2. Consider Edge Cases: Reflect on all scenarios in which the code should operate.
3. Evaluate Functionality: Determine whether the code successfully implements the intended functionality across these cases.
4. Classify the Code:
   - If the code requires changes, set classified_type to "Incorrect"
   - If the code does not require any changes, set classified_type to "Correct"
5. Suggest a Corrected Code Block: In the complete_code field, provide the corrected Python code (or the original code if no changes needed).

Important: Use only the classifications "Correct" or "Incorrect" (case sensitive).

Now, please review the code based on the following code block:

+from typing import List
+
+def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
+    
+    # Initialize an empty list of factors
+    factors = []
+    # Set the current number to the input number
+    current_number = n
+    # Set the divisor to 2
+    divisor = 2
+    # While the current number is greater than 1
+    while current_number > 1:
+        # If the current number is divisible by the divisor
+        if current_number % divisor == 0:
+            # Append the divisor to the list of factors
+            factors.append(divisor)
+            # Divide the current number by the divisor
+            current_number = current_number / divisor
+        # If the current number is not divisible by the divisor
+        else:
+            # Increment the divisor by 1
+            divisor += 1
+    # Return the list of factors
+    return factors
+ 

And the following problem description:

"Return list of prime factors of given integer in the order from smallest to largest.
    Each of the factors should be listed number of times corresponding to how many times it appeares in factorization.
    Input number should be equal to the product of all factors
    >>> factorize(8)
    [2, 2, 2]
    >>> factorize(25)
    [5, 5]
    >>> factorize(70)
    [2, 5, 7]"

You MUST respond in exactly this YAML format:

```yaml
feedback:
  classified_type: |
    Correct
code:
  complete_code: |
    from typing import List
    
    def function_name(parameters):
        # Your Python code here (corrected or original)
        return result
```

Apply the following rules strictly:
- Answer should be valid YAML and nothing else
- No additional text or explanations outside the YAML structure
- Replace the example code with your actual corrected/original code
- Ensure proper indentation (4 spaces for code inside complete_code)
- Be careful about the indentation and syntax of your suggested code block, make sure it can run without problems'''
