user='''You are an experienced Python developer. You will be provided with a code block and a corresponding problem description. Your task is to understand the intended functionality, review the code, and generate feedback. Please follow these steps:

1. Analyze the Code: Understand what the code is meant to do.
2. Consider Edge Cases: Reflect on all scenarios in which the code should operate.
3. Evaluate Functionality: Determine whether the code successfully implements the intended functionality across these cases.
4. Classify the Code:
   - If the code requires changes, set classified_type to "Incorrect"
   - If the code does not require any changes, set classified_type to "Correct"
5. Suggest a Corrected Code Block: In the complete_code field, provide the corrected Python code (or the original code if no changes needed).

Important: Use only the classifications "Correct" or "Incorrect" (case sensitive).

Now, please review the code based on the following code block:

+import math
+
+
+def poly(xs: list, x: float):
+    
+    return sum([coeff * math.pow(x, i) for i, coeff in enumerate(xs)])
+
+def find_zero(xs: list, epsilon=1e-6):
+    def poly(x):
+        return sum([coeff * math.pow(x, i) for i, coeff in enumerate(xs)])
+
+    a, b = -1e6, 1e6  # Initialize interval to large range around zero
+    while abs(b - a) > epsilon:  # Repeat until interval is narrow enough
+        mid = (a + b) / 2  # Find midpoint of interval
+        if poly(a) * poly(mid) < 0:  # Zero lies in left half of interval
+            b = mid
+        else:  # Zero lies in right half of interval
+            a = mid
+    return (a + b) / 2  # Return midpoint of final interval
+ 

And the following problem description:

"Evaluates polynomial with coefficients xs at point x.
    return xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[1] * x^2 + .... xs[n] * x^n
     xs are coefficients of a polynomial.
    find_zero find x such that poly(x) = 0.
    find_zero returns only only zero point, even if there are many.
    Moreover, find_zero only takes list xs having even number of coefficients
    and largest non zero coefficient as it guarantees
    a solution.
    >>> round(find_zero([1, 2]), 2) # f(x) = 1 + 2x
    -0.5
    >>> round(find_zero([-6, 11, -6, 1]), 2) # (x - 1) * (x - 2) * (x - 3) = -6 + 11x - 6x^2 + x^3
    1.0"

You MUST respond in exactly this YAML format:

```yaml
feedback:
  classified_type: |
    Correct
code:
  complete_code: |
    from typing import List
    
    def function_name(parameters):
        # Your Python code here (corrected or original)
        return result
```

Apply the following rules strictly:
- Answer should be valid YAML and nothing else
- No additional text or explanations outside the YAML structure
- Replace the example code with your actual corrected/original code
- Ensure proper indentation (4 spaces for code inside complete_code)
- Be careful about the indentation and syntax of your suggested code block, make sure it can run without problems'''
