user='''You are an experienced Python developer. You will be provided with a code block. Your task is to understand the intended functionality, review the code, and generate feedback. Please follow these steps:

1. Analyze the Code: Understand what the code is meant to do.
2. Consider Edge Cases: Reflect on all scenarios in which the code should operate.
3. Evaluate Functionality: Determine whether the code successfully implements the intended functionality across these cases.
4. Classify the Code:
   - If the code requires changes, set classified_type to "Incorrect"
   - If the code does not require any changes, set classified_type to "Correct"
5. Suggest a Corrected Code Block: In the complete_code field, provide the corrected Python code (or the original code if no changes needed).

Important: Use only the classifications "Correct" or "Incorrect" (case sensitive).

Now, please review the code based on the following code block:

+from typing import List, Tuple
+
+def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:
+    
+    # Sort the list of numbers
+    numbers.sort()
+    # Initialize variables to store the closest numbers
+    closest_a, closest_b = numbers[0], numbers[1]
+    # Initialize a variable to store the minimum difference between two numbers
+    min_diff = abs(numbers[0] - numbers[1])
+    # Iterate through the list of numbers
+    for i in range(1, len(numbers) - 1):
+        # Calculate the difference between the current number and the next one
+        diff = abs(numbers[i] - numbers[i+1])
+        # If the difference is smaller than the minimum difference, update the minimum difference and the closest numbers
+        if diff < min_diff:
+            min_diff = diff
+            closest_a, closest_b = numbers[i], numbers[i+1]
+    # Return the closest numbers
+    return closest_a, closest_b
+

You MUST respond in exactly this YAML format:

```yaml
feedback:
  classified_type: |
    Correct
code:
  complete_code: |
    from typing import List
    
    def function_name(parameters):
        # Your Python code here (corrected or original)
        return result
```

Apply the following rules strictly:
- Answer should be valid YAML and nothing else
- No additional text or explanations outside the YAML structure
- Replace the example code with your actual corrected/original code
- Ensure proper indentation (4 spaces for code inside complete_code)
- Make sure your code can run without syntax errors'''
