user='''You are an experienced Python developer. You will be provided with a code block. Your task is to understand the intended functionality, review the code, and generate feedback. Please follow these steps:

1. Analyze the Code: Understand what the code is meant to do.
2. Consider Edge Cases: Reflect on all scenarios in which the code should operate.
3. Evaluate Functionality: Determine whether the code successfully implements the intended functionality across these cases.
4. Classify the Code:
   - If the code requires changes, set classified_type to "Incorrect"
   - If the code does not require any changes, set classified_type to "Correct"
5. Suggest a Corrected Code Block: In the complete_code field, provide the corrected Python code (or the original code if no changes needed).

Important: Use only the classifications "Correct" or "Incorrect" (case sensitive).

Now, please review the code based on the following code block:

@@ -0,0 +1,23 @@
+import re
+
+def valid_date(date):
+    if not date:
+        return False
+    match = re.search(r'^(0[1-9]|1[0-2])-(0[1-9]|1[0-9]|2[0-9]|3[01])-(19|20)\d{2}$', date)
+    if match:
+        month, day, year = match.groups()
+        if int(month) in (1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12):
+            if int(day) < 1 or int(day) > 31:
+                return False
+        elif int(month) in (4, 6, 9, 11):
+            if int(day) < 1 or int(day) > 30:
+                return False
+        elif int(month) == 2:
+            if int(day) < 1 or int(day) > 29:
+                return False
+        else:
+            return False
+        return True
+    else:
+        return False
+

You MUST respond in exactly this YAML format:

```yaml
feedback:
  classified_type: |
    Correct
code:
  complete_code: |
    from typing import List
    
    def function_name(parameters):
        # Your Python code here (corrected or original)
        return result
```

Apply the following rules strictly:
- Answer should be valid YAML and nothing else
- No additional text or explanations outside the YAML structure
- Replace the example code with your actual corrected/original code
- Ensure proper indentation (4 spaces for code inside complete_code)
- Make sure your code can run without syntax errors'''
