user='''You are an experienced Python developer. You will be provided with a code block. Your task is to understand the intended functionality, review the code, and generate feedback. Please follow these steps:

1. Analyze the Code: Understand what the code is meant to do.
2. Consider Edge Cases: Reflect on all scenarios in which the code should operate.
3. Evaluate Functionality: Determine whether the code successfully implements the intended functionality across these cases.
4. Classify the Code:
   - If the code requires changes, set classified_type to "Incorrect"
   - If the code does not require any changes, set classified_type to "Correct"
5. Suggest a Corrected Code Block: In the complete_code field, provide the corrected Python code (or the original code if no changes needed).

Important: Use only the classifications "Correct" or "Incorrect" (case sensitive).

Now, please review the code based on the following code block:

@@ -0,0 +1,19 @@
+def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
+    result = []
+    current_string = []
+    current_depth = 0
+
+    for c in paren_string:
+        if c == '(':
+            current_depth += 1
+            current_string.append(c)
+        elif c == ')':
+            current_depth -= 1
+            current_string.append(c)
+
+            if current_depth == 0:
+                result.append(''.join(current_string))
+                current_string.clear()
+
+    return result
+

You MUST respond in exactly this YAML format:

```yaml
feedback:
  classified_type: |
    Correct
code:
  complete_code: |
    from typing import List
    
    def function_name(parameters):
        # Your Python code here (corrected or original)
        return result
```

Apply the following rules strictly:
- Answer should be valid YAML and nothing else
- No additional text or explanations outside the YAML structure
- Replace the example code with your actual corrected/original code
- Ensure proper indentation (4 spaces for code inside complete_code)
- Make sure your code can run without syntax errors'''
